Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI is broadly categorized into narrow AI, designed for specific tasks like image recognition, and general AI, which aims to mimic human cognitive abilities across diverse tasks. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training models on data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Deep learning, a further subset, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns, powering applications like speech recognition and autonomous vehicles. AI is transforming industries, including healthcare, where it aids in diagnostics, and finance, where it enhances fraud detection. Ethical concerns, such as bias in algorithms and job displacement, remain significant challenges. Ongoing research aims to improve AI's efficiency, interpretability, and alignment with human values.
